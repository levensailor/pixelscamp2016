I'll implement 2 very simple services using Spring Boot, show you how to register them, fetch their configuration from Consul (A KMS service should be used for this, but it would make this presentation longer and more complex) and transform each of the components into Docker Containers.\n\n[speaker: Luis Duarte, https://pixels.camp/driverpt]\n[language: English]", "SEQUENCE": "0", "URL": "https://github.com/PixelsCamp/talks/blob/master/bootstrap-your-app-with-micro-services_luis-duarte.md", "CREATED": "2016-08-22 16:06:09+00:00", "avatars": {"driverpt": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1164534?v=3"}, "SUMMARY": "Bootstrap your app using Microservices", "LOCATION": "Stage 3", "DTEND": "2016-10-08 13:00:00+01:00", "DTSTART": "2016-10-08 12:00:00+01:00", "id": "9e2bc5f1626aa6581c1cc33217418bd374253616", "UID": "5AC8D30E-A27E-4227-987D-A363A6922E42"}, {"DTSTAMP": "2016-08-24 16:34:19+00:00", "UID": "BADC44DF-E7D6-427B-A826-D3E2D8AE380F", "CREATED": "2016-08-24 16:34:19+00:00", "SEQUENCE": "0", "SUMMARY": "Lunch", "LOCATION": "Kitchen", "DTEND": "2016-10-08 14:00:00+01:00", "DTSTART": "2016-10-08 13:00:00+01:00"}, {"DTSTAMP": "2016-08-24 16:34:24+00:00", "UID": "D3F8B63E-E1FB-4426-BC3B-27745BDA924A", "CREATED": "2016-08-24 16:12:40+00:00", "SEQUENCE": "0", "SUMMARY": "48 hour non-stop programming contest ends", "LOCATION": "LX Factory", "DTEND": "2016-10-08 14:00:00+01:00", "DTSTART": "2016-10-08 13:00:00+01:00"}, {"DTSTAMP": "2016-08-22 16:11:48+00:00", "UID": "97070CFB-DCB9-4BAE-A2DC-004BBC1874AD", "CREATED": "2016-08-22 16:11:26+00:00", "SEQUENCE": "0", "SUMMARY": "Stage tests for final presentations", "LOCATION": "Bright Stage", "DTEND": "2016-10-08 15:00:00+01:00", "DTSTART": "2016-10-08 14:00:00+01:00"}, {"DTSTAMP": "2016-08-22 16:12:19+00:00", "UID": "D081FC53-6198-4A0F-9EA6-D4F2BC13A977", "CREATED": "2016-08-22 16:11:58+00:00", "SEQUENCE": "0", "SUMMARY": "Final Projects Presentations", "LOCATION": "Bright Stage", "DTEND": "2016-10-08 17:30:00+01:00", "DTSTART": "2016-10-08 15:00:00+01:00"}, {"DTSTAMP": "2016-08-22 16:12:57+00:00", "UID": "BDF2433F-08FB-40D1-9131-489826504AC9", "CREATED": "2016-08-22 16:12:23+00:00", "SEQUENCE": "0", "SUMMARY": "Final remarks & Closing", "LOCATION": "Bright Stage", "DTEND": "2016-10-08 18:00:00+01:00", "DTSTART": "2016-10-08 17:30:00+01:00"}, {"DTSTAMP": "2016-08-22 16:13:26+00:00", "UID": "8B95F1C8-623E-49A8-83F9-AC3F67449AE7", "CREATED": "2016-08-22 16:12:59+00:00", "SEQUENCE": "0", "SUMMARY": "Project Winners & Prizes", "LOCATION": "Bright Stage", "DTEND": "2016-10-08 19:00:00+01:00", "DTSTART": "2016-10-08 18:00:00+01:00"}]
